        <p>RePuff was founded in 2023 with a mission to breathe new life into old materials by creating stylish puffer bags. Through repurposing discarded items, I aimed to blend fashion with eco-consciousness. Embracing a lifestyle without electricity, I honed my sewing skills using traditional manual tools to craft each bag by hand.

            To source materials, I collaborated with local recycling initiatives, thrift stores, and friends and family. I carefully selected discarded bags, blankets, and other reusable fabrics, ensuring that each piece carried a unique story.
            
            My unique creations attracted like-minded individuals who shared my values. Together with local artisans, we formed a vibrant community rooted in sustainable craftsmanship.
            
            RePuff thrives as a testament to the power of resourcefulness, mindful production, and unwavering dedication to sustainability and fashion.</p>
